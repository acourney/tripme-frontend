# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was created with React, Bootstrap, and Chatengine.io
## Project Description:

TripMe is a travel planning website. 

On the tripme website, you can create trips, make todo lists for each trip, and share your trip with friends so they can view it from their own account.

Using a chatengine.io message center, you can create chat groups and message your friends to plan trips together.
